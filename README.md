# Getting Started with Create React App


## Available Commands
From the project directory, you can execute the following:

### npm start
Starts the application in development mode.
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The app will automatically reload when changes are made.
You may also see any linting errors in the console.

### npm test
Runs the test suite in interactive watch mode.
For more details, refer to the running tests section.

### npm run build
Creates a production-ready build in the build folder.
This bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build output is minified, and filenames will include hashes.
Your app is now ready to be deployed!

For more information, see the deployment guide.

### npm run eject
Caution: This is a one-way action. Once you eject, it can't be undone!

If you're not satisfied with the default toolchain and configurations, you can run eject at any time. This will remove the single build dependency and copy all configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) and transitive dependencies directly into your project, giving you full control.

All commands will continue to work after ejecting, but will now reference the copied scripts, allowing for customization. However, once ejected, you are on your own.

You are not required to eject. The default setup works well for small to medium-sized projects, and there's no need to use this feature unless you're ready to customize the configuration to suit your needs.
